# XpDrop Plugin - Get From Blocks In a Towny Server
Minecraft plugin for getting exp from crops. Small project 
### Config File
- once the plugin is run for the first time, a config file is created in XPCrops folder under plugins. By default, only melons and pumpkins are included and default xp value is 15.
- This specifies blocks that give xp. This can be edited. Note this has to follow the standard naming conventions for blocks
### Future Work
- Specifying exp gained depending on which crop or block is broken
- Change to allow decision to give XP direct to player or as orbs
