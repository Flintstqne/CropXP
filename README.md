# CropXP Plugin - Get From Blocks In Any Server
Minecraft plugin for getting exp from crops. Small side project
### Config File
- once the plugin is run for the first time, a config file is created in CropXP folder under plugins. By default all crops are included and default xp value is 15.
- This specifies blocks that give xp. This can be edited. Note this has to follow the standard naming conventions for crops.
- List of options: POTATOES, CARROTS, COCOA, BEETROOTS, WHEAT, MELON, PUMPKIN, NETHER_WART
### Future Work
- Specifying exp gained depending on which crop or block is broken
- Change to allow decision to give XP direct to player or as orbs
